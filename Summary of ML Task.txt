**Summary:**
**Data Analysis Key Findings**
**Missing Data:** 
i found no missing data in it.

**Data Type Issues:**

data types are correct

**Relationships between Variables:** 
ðŸ”´ Strong Positive Correlations (Close to +1)
Math score vs. Reading score: 0.82

Math score vs. Writing score: 0.80

Reading score vs. Writing score: 0.95 (Strongest positive correlation in the heatmap.

These indicate that students who score well in one subject tend to score well in the others.


ðŸ”µ Strong Negative Correlations (Close to -1)
Lunch (free/reduced) vs. Scores:

Math score: -0.35

Reading score: -0.32

Writing score: -0.30
(Students with free/reduced lunch tend to score lower.)

Test preparation course (none) vs. Scores:

Math: -0.18

Reading: -0.24

Writing: -0.31

âœ… Summary of Most Influential Factors:
Reading â†” Writing: Most strongly correlated (0.95)

Lunch type and Test preparation course significantly impact performance.

Gender and Race/Ethnicity have minor influence on scores.

**Data Cleaning Challenges:** 
There is no nan or missing valyes or non numeric in numeric data and vice versa. Although i find some outliers and cap it accordingly.

**At the end Model is trained well and R2 score is good**
